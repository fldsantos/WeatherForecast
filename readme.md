# Weather Forecast

## Small project to help me understand Java HTTP requests, along with its syntax, libaries, and dependencies.

### This program prompts the user to write a location, then retrieves weather details for that location, such as temperature, sky likeness, and country.

I heard about weather APIs, and wondered how challenging it would be to retrieve data from it and display it to the user in Java. This project helped me understand Java a lot better, and made me familiarized with its API handling.

# Development Environment

This project was written in Intellij IDEA. I downloaded the full version, and my student email gave me full access to the tool. I set up the project with Gradle, and Coretto 21 JDK.

The programming language I used was Java, and I used some of its built-in libraries like BufferedReader, FileWriter, HTTPclient, and JSONobject.
